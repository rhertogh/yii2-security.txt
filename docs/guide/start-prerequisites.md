What do you need to know before installing Yii2 security.txt
============================================================

Although this package aims to be as self-explanatory as possible, some prior knowledge is required.

## RFC 9116: A File Format to Aid in Security Vulnerability Disclosure

This extension generates a "security.txt" file based on the [RFC 9116 specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9116).  
It is recommended to read it first in order to understand the different settings better.


## Yii2 pretty URLs

In order for the Yii2 security.txt extension to work properly pretty URLs must be enabled in the application.  
Please see the [Yii2 guide](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/runtime-routing#using-pretty-urls).
